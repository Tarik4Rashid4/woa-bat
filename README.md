# woa-bat
This investigation paves a way to present a new technique by hybridizing both WOA and BAT algorithms. 
The BAT algorithm is used for the exploration phase, whereas the WOA algorithm is used for the exploitation phase. 
Finally, statistical results obtained from WOA-BAT are very competitive and better than WOA in 16 benchmarks functions. 
WOA-BAT also outperforms well in 13 functions from CEC2005 and 7 functions from CEC2019
